title: Transliterations
---

Status: **Official Style Guideline**

Transliteration is the conversion from one script to another, e.g., from
Latin to Kanji, Kanji to Cyrillic, Cyrillic to Hebrew, etc. Often,
releases will be transliterated for the benefit of people who enjoy the
music but cannot read the original script. While transliteration to the
Latin script is the most common, it is not the only possibility.

Guideline
=========

Transliterated
`pseudo-releases </style_guides/types_of_releases/pseudo-releases>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}[^1] should conform to the rules of the transliteration
system used.

Some languages have specific capitalization guidelines for
transliterations:

::: {.toctree}
/style\_guides/language\_guides/chinese
/style\_guides/language\_guides/hebrew
/style\_guides/language\_guides/japanese
/style\_guides/language\_guides/yiddish
:::

For any other transliterations to scripts that have a capitalization
concept[^2]:

If the source script also has a capitalization concept, keep the
original capitalization. Otherwise, then only the first letter of each
sentence and proper nouns should be capitalized.

**Notes**

[^1]: At the time this guideline is being adopted,
    `NGS </terminology/terms/ngs>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} is
    getting close. In NGS, capitalization of
    `official releases <entities_release_status>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} should not be normalized. This guideline is limited to
    pseudo-releases in order to avoid such \"destructive\"
    capitalization changes.

[^2]: Scripts that have a capitalization concept include
    [Armenian](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/armenian.htm),
    [Cyrillic](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/cyrillic.htm),
    [Deseret](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/deseret.htm), [Georgian
    (Mkhedruli)](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/georgian2.htm),
    [Greek](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/greek.htm) and
    [Latin](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/latin.htm).
